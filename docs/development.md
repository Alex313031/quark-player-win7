This app is based on Electron, a Chromium wrapper.

Requires nodejs 12, 14, or 16. Lower or higher will not work. It is reccomended to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for installing/managing node versions.
Yarn can also be used.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alex313031/quarkplayer.git
cd quarkplayer
nvm install # Only use if you are using nvm
npm install # Install needed npm deps
npm run start # Run app in dev mode
npm run dist # To make installation packages
```
